# Hawaii-Airbnb-Price-Predication

 This paper will develop a model for price prediction
based on the features that hosts offer in Airbnb listings. The goal
is to help Airbnb hosts to set their prices more effectively and
understand the pricing market in Airbnb better with different
aspects. The algorithms that this paper will use are Linear
regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network. The metrics to
evaluate the performance of the models are MAE, RMSE, and Rsquared scores. 

## Dataset
[Data source: Inside airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

The dataset for this paper is multiple datasets in
months combined. I merged all the datasets between May 2020
to April 2021 to create a large dataset for Hawaii Airbnb
listings.

The dataset is split into two different ranges:

1. low-price range from $11 to $999 per night
2. high-price range, from $1,000 to $25,000 per night
